This extension gives you rich editing powers for markdown documents, and removes irritating manual interventions you may need to make for dynamic content.

More features are being added to get closer to a word processor experience. üí™

Reasons to choose this extension:
1. Awesome features. üöÄ
1. Small size with zero bloat: Many extensions include unnecessary files in the extension and do not optimize the resources. Expect this extension to load faster than average. ‚ö°
1. Loaded only when necessary: It is loaded only when you have markdown documents open. Some extensions are loaded for every project with a README, lurking in memory never to be used! üëª
1. Tested well. The extensions have test suites, it is alarming how many extensions have zero tests! ‚úî
1. Modular design. This is an Extension Pack, features are separated into different extensions, don't want all of the features? Then, only install the specific extensions you want! üì¶üì¶
1. I use these extensions and actively maintain them. üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Features

The command `Marky Dynamic: Remove the Table of Contents (TOC)` will remove the TOC.

### 2) Manage Heading Bookmarks

It is helpful to readers to have a link in headings for bookmarking different sections of a document. You probably have seen this done automatically by GitHub to `readme.md` files, like in the image below.

<img src="img/screenshots/heading-link.jpg" style="border:1px black solid;" alt="heading link" /><br>

The command `Marky Dynamic: Add/Update Heading Bookmarks` will add bookmarks to the headings in the **active markdown document**.

![add bookmark link to headings](img/screenshots/add-heading-link.gif)

By default, it will add a link with the text '**‚àû**', this is the infinity character, which looks like a link! In the Settings, you can customise this text (`Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Bookmarks: Link Text`), or specify an image (`Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Bookmarks: Link Image Path`). If you provide text and an image, the image will come first.

The command `Marky Dynamic: Remove Heading Bookmarks` will remove the bookmark links.

### 3) Manage Section Numbering

The command `Marky Dynamic: Add/Update Section Numbering` will add section numbers to the headings in the **active markdown document**.

The command `Marky Dynamic: Remove Section Numbering` will remove the section numbers.

### 4) Document Stats

A stat for the document is added to the status bar. By default, it is the *Reading Time*. You can choose an alternative by clicking the status bar item, and selecting from the quickpick menu.
