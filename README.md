## Commands

The following commands can be run from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):

1. `Marky Markdown: Add/Update the Table of Contents (TOC)`
1. `Marky Markdown: Remove the Table of Contents (TOC)`
1. `Marky Markdown: Add/Update Heading Bookmarks`
1. `Marky Markdown: Remove Heading Bookmarks`

## Features

### 1. Manage a Table of Contents (TOC)

A table of contents (TOC) is a list of links to the headings within your document. It makes it easier to navigate to different sections of your document.

The command `Marky Markdown: Add/Update the Table of Contents (TOC)` will add a TOC **at the cursor position in the active markdown document**. If the TOC exists already, it will be updated.

It does the following:

- Searches for open and closed ATX-style headings (the ones that use hashes).
- **Includes headings levels 2 through 6 by default.** You can change this in the Settings through the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Bookmarks: Level Range` option.
- It creates links excluding bookmark links.
- It adds a CodeLens entry to the top of the TOC indicating if it is "up-to-date" with the document. You can click this entry to update the TOC.

**You can choose to have the TOC update automatically whenever the document is saved by enabling the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Update On Save` option in the Settings**. The performance is good, it will not be an issue if you have [Autosave](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_save-auto-save) set to save "after a delay" of approximately 1 second, but you should be mindful of what other extensions are up to!

You can also choose to add a label to the top of the TOC by editing the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Table Of Contents: Label` option in the Settings.

The command `Marky Markdown: Remove the Table of Contents (TOC)` will remove the TOC.

### 2. Manage Heading Bookmarks

It is helpful to readers to have a link in headings for bookmarking different sections of a document. You probably have seen this done automatically by Github to `readme.md` files, like in the image below.

The command `Marky Markdown: Add/Update Heading Bookmarks` will add bookmark links to the headings in the **active markdown document**.

![add bookmark link to headings](img/screenshots/add-heading-link.gif)

It does the following:

- Searches for open and closed ATX-style headings (the ones that use hashes).
- **Includes headings levels 2 through 6 by default.** You can change this in the Settings through the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Table of Contents: Level Range` option.
- By default, it will add a link with the text '**‚àû**', this is the infinity character, which looks like a link! In the Settings, you can customise this text (`Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Bookmarks: Link Text`), or specify an image (`Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Bookmarks: Link Image Path`). If you provide text and an image, the image will come first.

**You can choose to have the bookmarks update automatically whenever the document is saved by enabling the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Update On Save` option in the Settings**.

The command `Marky Markdown: Remove Heading Bookmarks` will remove the bookmark links.
