## Commands

The following commands can be run from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):

1. `Marky Markdown: Add/Update the Table of Contents (TOC)`
1. `Marky Markdown: Remove the Table of Contents (TOC)`
1. `Marky Markdown: Add/Update Heading Bookmark Links`
1. `Marky Markdown: Remove Heading Bookmark Links`

## Features

### 1. Manage a Table of Contents (TOC)

A table of contents (TOC) is a list of links to the headings within your document. It makes it easier to navigate to different sections of your document.

The command `Marky Markdown: Add/Update the Table of Contents (TOC)` will add a TOC **at the cursor position in the active markdown document**. If the TOC exists already, it will be updated.

**The default is to include every level 2 heading and below (levels 2 through 6) in the TOC**. You can change this in the Settings through the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Heading: Upper Level` option.

There is a CodeLens entry added to the TOC indicating if it is up-to-date with the document. You can click this entry to update the TOC.

You can choose to have the TOC **update automatically whenever the document is saved** by enabling the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Table Of Contents: Update On Save` option in the Settings. The performance is good, it will not be an issue if you have [Autosave](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_save-auto-save) set to save "after a delay" of approximately 1 second. It is worth checking to see if other extensions are performing actions frequently, especially when saving, too much happening at once and you will notice lag. Typically formatters, linters, and extensions that use Code Lenses (Git Lens) are frequently performing actions.

You can also choose to add a label to the top of the TOC by editing the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Table Of Contents: Label` option in the Settings.

The command `Marky Markdown: Remove a Table of Contents (TOC)` will remove the TOC.

### 2. Manage Heading Bookmark Links

It is helpful to readers to have a link in headings for bookmarking different sections of a document. You probably have seen this done automatically by Github to `readme.md` files, like in the image below.

<img src="img/screenshots/heading-link.jpg" style="border:1px black solid;" alt="heading link" /><br>

The command `Marky Markdown: Add/Update Heading Bookmark Links` will add bookmark links to the headings in the **active markdown document**. **The default is to include every level 2 heading and below (levels 2 through 6)**. You can change this in the Settings through the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Heading: Upper Level` option.

![add bookmark link to headings](img/screenshots/add-heading-link.gif)

By default, it will add a link with the text '**‚àû**', this is the infinity character, which looks like a link! In the Settings, you can customise this text (`Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Heading: Link Text`), or specify an image (`Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Heading: Link Image Path`). If you provide text and an image, the image will come first.

The command `Marky Markdown: Remove Heading Bookmark Links` will remove the bookmark links.
