## Commands

The following commands can be run from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):

1. `Marky Markdown: Add/Update the Table of Contents (TOC)`
1. `Marky Markdown: Remove the Table of Contents (TOC)`
1. `Marky Markdown: Add/Update Heading Bookmarks`
1. `Marky Markdown: Remove Heading Bookmarks`
1. `Marky Markdown: Add/Update Section Numbering`
1. `Marky Markdown: Remove Section Numbering`

## Features

### (1) Manage a Table of Contents (TOC)

The command `Marky Markdown: Add/Update the Table of Contents (TOC)` will add a table of contents (TOC) **at the cursor position in the active markdown document**. If the TOC exists already, it will be updated.

![Add TOC](img/screenshots/add-toc.gif)

It does the following:

- Searches for open and closed ATX-style headings (the ones that use hashes).
- **Includes headings levels 2 through 6 by default.** You can change this in the Settings through the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Bookmarks: Level Range` option.
- It creates a link with the URL based on the setting `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Slugify Style`. It excludes the text from bookmark links.
- It creates an unordered list of the links. Indentation is based on your User Settings (`Editor: Insert Spaces`, `Editor: Tab Size`, and `Editor: Detect Indentation` )
- It adds a CodeLens entry to the top of the TOC indicating if it is "up-to-date" with the document. You can click this entry to update the TOC.

- You can choose to have the TOC update automatically whenever the document is saved by enabling the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Update On Save` option in the Settings. The performance is good, it will not be an issue if you have [Autosave](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_save-auto-save) set to save "after a delay" of approximately 1 second, but you should be mindful of what other extensions are up to!
- You can choose to add a label to the top of the TOC by editing the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Table Of Contents: Label` option in the Settings.

The command `Marky Markdown: Remove the Table of Contents (TOC)` will remove the TOC.

### (2) Manage Heading Bookmarks

It is helpful to readers to have a link in headings for bookmarking different sections of a document. You probably have seen this done automatically by GitHub to `readme.md` files, like in the image below.

<img src="img/screenshots/heading-link.jpg" style="border:1px black solid;" alt="heading link" /><br>

The command `Marky Markdown: Add/Update Heading Bookmarks` will add bookmark links to the headings in the **active markdown document**.

![add bookmark link to headings](img/screenshots/add-heading-link.gif)

It does the following:

- Searches for open and closed ATX-style headings (the ones that use hashes).
- **Includes headings levels 2 through 6 by default.** You can change this in the Settings through the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Table of Contents: Level Range` option.
- By default, it will add a link with the text '**‚àû**', this is the infinity character, which looks like a link! In the Settings, you can customise this text (`Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Bookmarks: Link Text`), or specify an image (`Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Bookmarks: Link Image Path`). If you provide text and an image, the image will come first.
- The URL generated is based on the setting `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Slugify Style`. It excludes the text from bookmark links.
- You can choose to have the bookmarks update automatically whenever the document is saved by enabling the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Update On Save` option in the Settings.

The command `Marky Markdown: Remove Heading Bookmarks` will remove the bookmark links.

### (3) Manage Section Numbering

The command `Marky Markdown: Add/Update Section Numbering` will add section numbers to the headings in the **active markdown document**.

It does the following:

- Searches for open and closed ATX-style headings (the ones that use hashes).
- **Includes headings levels 2 through 6 by default.** You can change this in the Settings through the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Section Numbering: Level Range` option.

The command `Marky Markdown: Remove Section Numbering` will remove the section numbers.
